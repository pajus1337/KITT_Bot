## Why C#?

C# has been chosen for this project due to its robust framework, efficiency, and my personal comfort with the language. This decision also aligns with my goal to further develop my skills in a structured and challenging environment.

## Vision:

The aim is to create a versatile IRC bot that not only brings the essence of "Knight Rider's" KITT into the digital world ;-) but also enhances the IRC community experience through automation, engagement, and intelligence. As the project evolves, so will its capabilities, making KITT Bot a cornerstone of innovation and interaction within IRC channels.
